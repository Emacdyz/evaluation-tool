# Student Evaluation Tool Front-End

This is the frontend for the student evaluation tool, where you can grade students with a color code, base on their performance during Codaisseur Academy. It's build using the standard `create-react-app` so the usual `yarn start` can be used.

The backend (server) of this project must be running for the app to function correctly.
